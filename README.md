## Workout Routine

- Occasionally **Abs** will be swapped in for one of the gym sessions.  
- Usually on off-days I’ll still be active with golf, walking, or biking.
- Some weeks I’ll mix in **3 days of cardio** (usually if the weather is good ☀️).
- I generally fit the routine around where I’m working (e.g. more running when based in Wellington).
