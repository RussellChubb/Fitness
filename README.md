## Workout Routine

- Occasionally **Abs** will be swapped in for one of the gym sessions.  
- Usually on off-days I’ll still be active with golf, biking, or surfing.
- Some weeks I’ll mix in **3 days of cardio** (*usually if the weather is good ☀️*).
- I generally fit the routine around where I’m working (*e.g. more running when based in Wellington*).

| Day | Training |
|----|---------|
| Mon | Upper A (*Strength*) |
| Tue | Cardio |
| Wed | Lower A (*Strength*) |
| Thu | Cardio |
| Fri | Upper B (*Hypertrophy*) |
| Sat | Lower B (*Hypertrophy*) |
| Sun | Off / Light Work |
