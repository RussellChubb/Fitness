## Workout Routine

* Occasionaly "Abs" will be swapped in for one of the Gym sessions*
* Usually on off day's I'll still be getting active with either golf, a walk or some kind of bike ride.*
* Some week's I'll mix in 3 days a week of Cardio (*usually if the weather is good!*)
* I'll usually try fit the routine to where I'm working, ergo, it may not necessarily always be this (*i.e. I go running a lot when I work in Wellington*)
